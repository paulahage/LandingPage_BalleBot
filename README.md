# Landing Page - Balle Bot

This is an exercise from Rafaella Ballerini youtube channel.<br>
<br>
The project was developed based on the design provided by Rafaella on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/myqP66iQwzjwjrIAJyyrip/BalleBot?node-id=0%3A1) with the main goal of teaching how to build a Landing Page using HTML and CSS Flexbox.<br>
To challenge myself, I decided to implement a responsive design to practice the usage of Media Queries.
